<b>FINITE LOGIC: EthosGuard - Model Drift Validator</b>

EthosGuard provides an immutable, transparent logging mechanism for machine learning models running in production. It uses a signed, linked-list structure (a micro-blockchain concept) to record every prediction and the associated feature vector, creating a provable audit trail.

<b>Solved Problem: </b>

In highly regulated or ethically sensitive fields (e.g., finance, hiring), models can "drift" or develop unintended biases over time, leading to unfair decisions. EthosGuard guarantees that every decision can be traced back to its exact state, facilitating post-mortem bias analysis and compliance audits.
